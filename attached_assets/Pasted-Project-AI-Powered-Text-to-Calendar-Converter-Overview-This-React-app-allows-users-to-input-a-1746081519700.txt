Project: AI-Powered Text-to-Calendar Converter

Overview

This React app allows users to input a block of text containing event details (e.g., "Meeting with John next Monday at 2 PM") and uses an AI LLM (such as OpenAI's GPT) to extract key event information and generate a calendar invite. The invite can be downloaded as an .ics file or added to Google Calendar.

Requirements

1. Frontend (React & TailwindCSS for styling)

User Interface (UI)

A simple input box (textarea) for users to enter text.

A button to process the input using AI.

A preview section displaying extracted event details.

An option to export the event as an .ics file.

A button to add to Google Calendar.


State Management

Use useState and useEffect hooks for managing input and response data.

2. AI Integration (LLM for Text Parsing)

Processing User Input

Use an API like OpenAI's GPT or Google’s Gemini to extract event details:

Date & Time

Event Title

Location (if available)

Description



Implementation Options

Use a backend (Node.js + Express) to call the AI API securely, or

Call the API directly from the frontend (ensure API key safety with environment variables).
